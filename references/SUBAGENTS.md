# Subagent integration

This skill installs project-scoped subagent templates for both Codex and Claude Code.

On the Codex side, these are custom agent TOML config layers, not a separate manifest format.

## Installed files

### Codex

```text
.codex/agents/task-spec-freezer.toml
.codex/agents/task-builder.toml
.codex/agents/task-verifier.toml
.codex/agents/task-fixer.toml
```

### Claude Code

```text
.claude/agents/task-spec-freezer.md
.claude/agents/task-builder.md
.claude/agents/task-verifier.md
.claude/agents/task-fixer.md
```

The agent files are intentionally narrow and role-specific.

## Codex file shape

Codex custom agents under `.codex/agents/` are standalone TOML config layers.

Each file in this skill defines:

- `name`
- `description`
- `developer_instructions`

The Codex templates also use `nickname_candidates` for cleaner UI labels when several spawned children are visible at once.

Other `config.toml` keys could be added later if needed, but this skill mostly inherits the parent session's model, sandbox, tools, and MCP configuration.

Codex also ships built-in `default`, `worker`, and `explorer` roles. This skill adds task-specific roles alongside those built-ins rather than replacing the general-purpose ones.

## Built-in Codex roles in this workflow

- Use built-in `explorer` for bounded read-only discovery before spec freeze and for read-only proof probes after build.
- Use built-in `worker` only when the task cleanly splits into disjoint implementation or check shards with explicit ownership.
- Keep `task-builder` as the integration owner. Even in broader-task Codex fan-out runs, that role remains the single writer for `evidence.md` and `evidence.json`.
- Keep `task-verifier` as the single fresh judge. Parallel helper children may gather inputs, but they do not write `verdict.json`.

## Role definitions

### `task-spec-freezer`

Purpose:
- Freeze the task into `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/spec.md`

Hard boundaries:
- May read repo guidance and relevant code
- Must not change production code
- Must not write verdict or problems files

### `task-builder`

Purpose:
- Implement the task and later pack evidence

Modes:
- `BUILD`
- `EVIDENCE`

Hard boundaries:
- In `BUILD`, implement against the spec
- In `EVIDENCE`, do not change production code

### `task-verifier`

Purpose:
- Fresh-session verification against the current codebase

Hard boundaries:
- Must not edit production code
- Must not patch the evidence bundle to make it look complete
- Must write `verdict.json`
- Must replace `problems.md` on every pass: zero problems for `PASS`, detailed findings for `FAIL` or `UNKNOWN`

### `task-fixer`

Purpose:
- Repair only what the verifier identified

Hard boundaries:
- Must reread the spec and verifier output
- Must reconfirm the problem before editing
- Must regenerate evidence after the fix
- Must not write final sign-off

## Codex invocation pattern

Use explicit delegation language at the parent-orchestrator layer. The skill should spawn one named child, wait for it, and then continue when delegation is the right internal choice.
Do not spawn any child until `init <TASK_ID>` has finished and `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/spec.md` exists.
Do not batch `init` with other commands or tool calls.

Codex-native expectations that matter here:

- The parent-orchestrator must explicitly spawn a new child, and in Codex it may do so only after the user has explicitly asked for sub-agents, delegation, or parallel agent work.
- Once delegation is authorized, the parent chooses the specific child roles. The user does not need to name the exact role or slash-command flow.
- Keep the task tree shallow. The parent session should orchestrate children directly instead of asking one custom task child to spawn more children.
- Inspect the current child-thread list with `/agent` in the CLI or the equivalent child-thread inventory surface exposed by the current Codex product surface before respawning or resuming a child.
- Use `send_input` to continue a live child.
- Use `resume_agent` only when you intentionally want an older builder or fixer child back. Do not reuse or resume a verifier when freshness matters.
- Before reusing or resuming a child, inspect the current child-thread list rather than assuming the needed child is gone.

Default Codex path for narrower tasks:

- One child per workflow role.
- Same builder child for evidence.
- Fresh verifier child for every verify pass.

Adaptive Codex fan-out path for broader tasks after delegation is explicitly authorized:

- Fan out up to 3 `explorer` children in parallel when the task needs parallel discovery before the spec is stable.
- Keep one `task-builder` child as the integration owner.
- If implementation splits cleanly, add bounded `worker` children in parallel with explicit file or module ownership.
- If proof needs multiple read-only probes, add bounded `explorer` children in parallel, but keep verdict writing with one fresh verifier child.

Suggested shape:

```text
Spawn one `task-spec-freezer` agent for TASK_ID <TASK_ID>. Wait for it. Tell it to freeze the spec in .agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/spec.md using the repo guidance and the task source.
```

Repeat the same pattern for `task-builder`, `task-verifier`, and `task-fixer`.

Keep delegation depth flat. The narrower-task path uses one child per role at a time; the broader-task path may fan out multiple bounded `explorer` or `worker` children in parallel.

Fan-out variant:

```text
Spawn two `explorer` children in parallel for TASK_ID <TASK_ID>.

Explorer A scope:
- path prefix: <PATH_A>
- question: <QUESTION_A>

Explorer B scope:
- path prefix: <PATH_B>
- question: <QUESTION_B>

Wait for both. Then fold their findings into one spec-freezer or builder step.
```

## Claude Code invocation pattern

Use the installed project subagents from `.claude/agents/`. Claude Code can automatically delegate from the main session to a matching subagent based on the task request, the subagent description, and current context, so normal proof-loop prompts do not need to name an agent explicitly.
Because this skill writes agent files directly on disk, if `init` just created or refreshed `.claude/agents/*` during the current Claude Code session, do not assume those refreshed agents are already available.
Treat these agents as preferred workflow roles whose descriptions should encourage automatic delegation from the main session. If automatic delegation is not precise enough, make the current proof-loop phase more explicit in the prompt. Keep verifier freshness and same-builder evidence reuse as hard workflow constraints.

TodoWrite or the visible task/todo list UI is optional session-scoped progress tracking only.

Suggested automatic shape:

```text
Freeze the repo-local spec for TASK_ID <TASK_ID> in `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/spec.md` before any implementation. Use explicit acceptance criteria and constraints.
```

For Claude Code, keep this distinction explicit:

- TodoWrite or the visible task/todo UI is optional live progress display for the current session.
- `.agent/tasks/<TASK_ID>/...` is the canonical durable proof-loop state.

When you need a specific role outcome, prefer an explicit natural-language phase prompt:

```text
Run a fresh verifier pass for TASK_ID <TASK_ID> against the current codebase. Replace both `verdict.json` and `problems.md`; write an explicit zero-problem report when the verdict is PASS.
```

For large tasks, prefer one workflow owner per role rather than handing the entire proof loop to one general-purpose child.
Descriptions in the Claude agent templates should read as proactive trigger conditions so Claude can delegate more reliably. Prefer wording that starts with `Use proactively when...`.
Keep the delegation flat. Main-session auto-delegation is the intended Claude path here; the workflow agents themselves are leaf roles, so the parent should orchestrate each role directly instead of asking one custom task agent to spawn another.

## Same-session evidence packing

The preferred pattern is:

1. Spawn `task-builder`
2. Let it implement
3. Continue with the same child in `EVIDENCE` mode

In Codex, this same-session follow-up is the preferred path. Keep the builder child alive and send it a follow-up instruction for evidence packing so it can reuse its own command results and local context.
If the parent used parallel explorers or workers earlier, the builder should still stay the single owner of `evidence.md` and `evidence.json` and cite those sibling results only after validating they still apply.

In Claude Code, this same-session follow-up is the default path. Only run a second `task-builder` child with an explicit `EVIDENCE-ONLY` prompt if the original builder session is unavailable or you intentionally want a fresh evidence-only run.

Verifier freshness is different. In Codex, each verification pass should use a fresh verifier child or a fresh standalone session, not a resumed verifier.

## Why the roles stay separate

The workflow is designed to keep:

- implementation
- judgment
- correction

as separate roles. This reduces self-justification and makes failures easier to localize.
